Collaboration: We recieved help from the amazing CS 40 TAs and the CS 40 
Piazza.

All files and functions have been correctly implemented.
Readaline can read in (theoretically) up to 2^15 characters or limit by the 
computer before breaking. This would take a lot of time and memory, however.
One error is that including LinePackage.h in LinePackage.c causes the program to
throw errors.

We spent 35 hours on this assignment.
